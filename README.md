SteenBudgetSolution is a comprehensive, full-stack personal finance management application designed to empower users to track income, expenses, and manage budgets effectively.

This project showcases the ability to design, build, deploy, and manage a complete application end-to-end, with a strong emphasis on **secure development practices**, **modern technologies**, **robust infrastructure**, and **efficient CI/CD workflows**, all self-hosted on a Raspberry Pi.

## Key Features

*   üîê **Secure User Authentication:** Robust JWT-based authentication featuring auto-refresh, periodic status checks, and WebSocket integration for immediate session termination. See the detailed **[Authentication Flow Guide](docs/Security/Authentication.md)**.
*   ü§ñ **ReCAPTCHA Integration:** Protects user registration from bots using Google reCAPTCHA v3.
*   üí∞ **Full CRUD Operations:** Manage budgets, income, and expense transactions with complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality.
*   üìß **Email Notifications:** Integrated SMTP client (using MailKit) for user email verification and essential notifications.
*   üì± **Responsive Design:** Modern, mobile-first UI built with Tailwind CSS ensures a great experience on any device.
*   üöÄ **Real-time Communication:** Employs WebSockets for immediate server-driven events (like session termination) and uses a ping/pong mechanism to maintain connection health. More details in the **[WebSocket Implementation Guide](docs/WebSocket/WebSocketHandler.md)**.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Hardened Security:** Multi-layered security approach including infrastructure hardening and application-level protections.
*   üìä **Centralized Logging:** Robust logging infrastructure using Graylog for enhanced monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**

*   **Framework:** .NET 8 (C#) with ASP.NET Core Web API
*   **Database:** MariaDB (SQL-based relational database)
*   **Data Access:** Dapper (Micro-ORM, chosen for performance and direct SQL control)
*   **Architecture:** Clean Architecture principles for separation of concerns and testability.
*   **Real-time:** ASP.NET Core WebSockets ([custom implementation](docs/WebSocket/WebSocketHandler.md))
*   **Email:** MailKit

**Frontend:**

*   **Framework:** React (TypeScript) for a robust and type-safe UI.
*   **Build Tool:** Vite for fast development server and optimized builds.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Utility-first CSS framework).
*   **API Communication:** Axios (with interceptor for token refresh - see [Authentication Flow](docs/Security/Authentication.md))

**Infrastructure & DevOps:**

*   **Host:** Self-hosted on Raspberry Pi (Linux OS)
*   **Web Server:** Nginx
*   **Database Server:** MariaDB Server
*   **Containerization:** Docker (used for Graylog dependencies: MongoDB & Elasticsearch)
*   **Logging:** Graylog (Centralized log management)
*   **Security Tools:** UFW (Firewall), Fail2Ban (Intrusion Prevention), Secure SSH (Key-based authentication)
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (Automated build, test, and deployment pipeline)
*   **Secrets Management:** GitHub Actions Secrets & Environment Variables on host.
*   **Domain & Network:** Custom Domain, DNS Management, Cloudflare, SSL Certificates (via Let's Encrypt)

## Core Concepts & Highlights

### üõ°Ô∏è Security First

Security is a core consideration throughout the stack:

*   **Authentication:** Robust multi-layered JWT implementation described in the **[Authentication Flow Guide](docs/Security/Authentication.md)**.
*   **Infrastructure:** Hardened server environment using UFW, Fail2Ban, and key-based SSH. Network protected by the UFW firewall and Cloudflare.
*   **Data Protection:** Secure handling of credentials using environment variables and GitHub Secrets. ReCAPTCHA prevents automated abuse.
*   **Email Security:** Recommended setup includes SPF and DKIM records for email authentication (details in `INSTALL.md`).
*   **Dependencies:** Regular monitoring/updating of dependencies.

### üöÄ DevOps & Self-Hosted Infrastructure

This project demonstrates practical DevOps skills managing a complete deployment environment on a Raspberry Pi:

*   **Full Setup:** Configuration of the Linux OS, Nginx web server, MariaDB database server, DNS records, and SSL certificates. For specific RPi configuration details, see the **[InstallMD](INSTALL.md)** 
*   **CI/CD Automation:** GitHub Actions pipeline handles testing, building, and deploying the application automatically on pushes to the main branch.
*   **Container Management:** Docker utilized effectively to manage dependencies for Graylog.

### üìä Centralized Logging with Graylog

*   Graylog provides powerful, centralized logging capabilities, aggregating logs from the .NET application and potentially the server itself.
*   Facilitates monitoring application health, diagnosing issues quickly, and analyzing usage patterns.
*   Requires Dockerized MongoDB and Elasticsearch (Setup detailed in `INSTALL.md`).

## Getting Started

For detailed instructions on setting up the development environment, configuring the infrastructure (including database, Graylog, security tools), and running the application, please refer to the comprehensive **main installation guide**:

## Why This Project?

This project serves as a practical demonstration of my ability to architect, develop, deploy, and manage a sophisticated full-stack application independently. It highlights proficiency in modern C#/.NET and React development, coupled with strong, hands-on experience in DevOps, infrastructure management, and security best practices within a real-world (self-hosted) environment.

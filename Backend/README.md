🛠️ Setup and Installation
Prerequisites

    .NET 8 SDK and Runtime installed.
    MariaDB for the database.
    SMTP server for email functionality.

⚙️ Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables to ensure proper functionality:
Required

    JWT_SECRET_KEY: Secret key for JWT authentication.
    DatabaseSettings__ConnectionString: Connection string for the MariaDB database.

Production Only

    SMTP_PASSWORD: Password for the SMTP server.
    SMTP_PASSWORD_INFO: Secondary SMTP password for contact/support emails.

🧩 Key Components

Core Layers

    Application: Contains services, DTOs, validators, and business logic interfaces.
    Domain: Houses the domain entities and models.
    Infrastructure: Manages data access and external services.
    Presentation: Provides API endpoints via controllers.

Test Folder

The backend.test folder, located in the root directory, contains unit and integration tests for the backend:

    Unit Tests: Validate individual components and services.
    Integration Tests: Test end-to-end functionality of APIs and database interactions.
    StartupTest.cs: Provides a custom configuration for testing environments.

Services and Features

    User Services: Handles user registration, authentication, and management.
    Token Services: Issues and validates JWTs.
    Email Services: Sends account verification and notification emails.

🛡️ Security

    JWT Authentication: Ensures secure access to the API.
    Environment Variables: Protects sensitive data.
    Firewall and Fail2Ban: Recommended for production environments.

🛠️ Testing

The Backend.Tests folder is structured to include both unit tests and integration tests, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the backend functionality:

    /Backend.Tests
    ├───Configuration          # Test-specific configuration setups
    ├───IntegrationTests       # End-to-end tests for APIs and services
    ├───UnitTests              # Isolated tests for individual components
    ├───Backend.Tests.cs       # Main test project file

Features of the Test Setup

    Organized Structure: Unit tests and integration tests are clearly separated into respective folders.
    Base Classes: Common test setups and helpers are included as base classes to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.
    Full Integration: Tests are fully integrated with the main project, making it easy to validate actual application functionality.
    Ease of Use: By aligning the test environment closely with the production setup, tests are straightforward to write and execute.

Running Tests

To run all tests:

    cd Backend.Tests
    dotnet test

Types of Tests

    Unit Tests: Focus on testing individual components or services in isolation.
    Integration Tests: Validate the interaction between various components, including database access and API endpoints.

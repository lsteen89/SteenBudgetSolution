Just like the previous documentation, this WebSocketHandler.md is very well-detailed for an internal team but reveals specific implementation details that are best kept private from a public repository.

Let's create two versions: a secure one for your public-facing documentation and a detailed guide to help you update your internal, private version.

1. Public-Facing Version (For README.md or Public Docs)

This version describes the functionality and purpose of the WebSocket handler without exposing internal details like command strings or buffer sizes. It's safe to include in your public repository.

Real-Time Communication: WebSocket Handler

Overview

Our backend includes a robust WebSocket handler to manage real-time, two-way communication with connected clients. This component is essential for features that require instant updates and server-initiated messages, such as live notifications and session management events.

Key Features

    Connection Lifecycle Management: Securely establishes, maintains, and gracefully terminates WebSocket connections.

    Bi-Directional Messaging: Provides a reliable pipeline for both client-to-server commands and server-to-client messages.

    Command Processing: Includes a message-processing framework capable of interpreting and acting on client-side commands in real time.

    Session Control: Integrates directly with our security system to handle session-related events, such as server-initiated logouts, ensuring that the client UI is always in sync with the user's authentication state.

    Scalability & Error Handling: Built to be resilient, with comprehensive logging and error handling to ensure connection stability and aid in monitoring.

How It's Used

The WebSocket handler is a core part of our application's infrastructure, enabling a responsive and interactive user experience. It is used primarily to:

    Push critical notifications from the server to the client instantly.

    Allow the client to send commands that require immediate server-side processing.

    Enforce security policies by allowing the server to terminate a client session in real time.

This handler forms the foundation of our real-time feature set and is designed to be both secure and extensible.

2. Guide to Update Your Internal WebSocketHandler.md

This is a step-by-step guide for you and your team to update the local, private version of the documentation. It ensures your internal document accurately reflects the current implementation.

Task: Update the Internal WebSocketHandler Documentation

Here is a guide to analyze your WebSocketHandler.cs file and update your internal documentation to match the current code.

Step 1: Locate the Source File üìÇ

    Open the latest version of your WebSocketHandler.cs file from your backend project.

Step 2: Analyze the HandleAsync Method ‚öôÔ∏è

This method contains the core logic. Read through it and answer the following questions to ensure your documentation is accurate.

    Buffer Size: What is the allocated buffer size for receiving messages? Look for the new byte[] declaration. (e.g., var buffer = new byte[4 * 1024];). Document this exact size.

    Main Loop Condition: How does the code check if the connection is still active? Confirm it's using a while loop that checks webSocket.State == WebSocketState.Open.

    Message Types Handled: What types of WebSocketReceiveResult messages does the code explicitly handle?

        Does it have a case for WebSocketMessageType.Close? What does it do? (e.g., "Logs the closure request and calls CloseAsync.")

        Does it handle WebSocketMessageType.Text?

    Command Processing Logic: Inside the handler for Text messages, how are commands processed?

        How is the incoming message decoded? (e.g., Encoding.UTF8.GetString(...)).

        Crucially, what are the exact command strings it listens for? Is it still just "logout" (case-insensitive)? Are there other commands?

        For each command, what is the exact response sent back to the client? (e.g., For "logout", it sends back "LOGOUT").

    Error Handling: Is the entire message receiving loop wrapped in a try...catch block? What type of exceptions does it catch (e.g., Exception or WebSocketException)? What does it do when an error is caught (e.g., logs the error, breaks the loop)?

Step 3: Draft the New Internal Document üìù

Using the information you just gathered, update your private WebSocketHandler.md file. Pay close attention to the Code Walkthrough section to make it as precise as possible for your team.

Example Update for the "Message Processing" Section:

        Message Processing

            The handler uses ReceiveAsync to wait for incoming data.

            When a message is received:

                If the message type is Close, the handler logs that the client is closing the connection and calls CloseAsync to close it gracefully from the server side.

                If the message type is Text, the message is decoded from UTF-8.

                The code then checks the message content. If the received text equals "logout" (case-insensitive), the handler sends a "LOGOUT" response back to the client and logs the forced logout action.

                (Add any other commands you found here).

By following these steps, you will create a new, accurate internal document that your team can rely on for development and debugging.

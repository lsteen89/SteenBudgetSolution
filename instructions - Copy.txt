Great! Now all that is left to do is to write unittests! 
Wizard tests are done here: 
SteenBudgetSolution\Backend.Tests\UnitTests\Services\WizardService\
So, we can create a new file named WizardServiceTestsFinalize in the FlowTests catalog. In it, we will write our tests for the service, and see the overall flow. 
You will use the three tests already in place as a guideline how to setup everything, we do have an testbase that implements everything we need.

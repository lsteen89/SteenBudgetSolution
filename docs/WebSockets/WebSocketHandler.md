# Real-Time Communication: WebSocket Handler

## Overview

Our backend includes a robust WebSocket handler to manage real-time, two-way communication with connected clients. This component is essential for features that require instant updates and server-initiated messages, such as live notifications and session management events.

## Key Features

- **Connection Lifecycle Management**: Securely establishes, maintains, and gracefully terminates WebSocket connections.
- **Bi-Directional Messaging**: Provides a reliable pipeline for both client-to-server commands and server-to-client messages.
- **Command Processing**: Includes a message-processing framework capable of interpreting and acting on client-side commands in real time.
- **Session Control**: Integrates directly with our security system to handle session-related events, such as server-initiated logouts, ensuring that the client UI is always in sync with the user's authentication state.
- **Scalability & Error Handling**: Built to be resilient, with comprehensive logging and error handling to ensure connection stability and aid in monitoring.

## How It's Used

The WebSocket handler is a core part of our application's infrastructure, enabling a responsive and interactive user experience. It is used primarily to:

- Push critical notifications from the server to the client instantly.
- Allow the client to send commands that require immediate server-side processing.
- Enforce security policies by allowing the server to terminate a client session in real time.

This handler forms the foundation of our real-time feature set and is designed to be both secure and extensible.
